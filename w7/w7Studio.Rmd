# Exercises


#### 1 ####

## a.
### Create a tsibble which is identical to the tourism tsibble from the package
### using the tourism.xlsx file 
setwd("~/DataScience/w7")
d <- read_csv("tourism.csv") %>%
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) %>%
  as_tsibble(key = c("Region", "State", "Purpose"), 
             index = "Quarter")

head(tourism)
data(tourism) # <-- what you want to recreate. This line loads the tourism dataset
# into your environment. Interact with it as normal. eg:
head(tourism)
```

```{r}
## b.
### Find the combination of Region and Purpose that had maximum number of  trips
### on average in 2001

d2 <- d %>%
  mutate(year = year(Quarter)) %>%
  filter(year == "2001") %>%
  group_by(Region, Purpose) %>%
  summarize(maximum = max(Trips)) %>%
  arrange(desc(maximum)) %>%
  glimpse() # Sydney + Business. 
```

```{r}
## c.
### Find the combination of Region and Purpose that had the maximum number of trips
### on average across all time

d %>%
  group_by(Region, Purpose) %>%
  summarize(mean_max = mean(Trips)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_max)) %>%
  glimpse() # Melbourne & Visiting. 

```

```{r}
## d.
### Plot the number of business trips per quarter in Melbourne
d %>%
  filter(Region == "Melbourne",
         Purpose == "Business") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() 


```

```{r}
## e. 
### Calculate and plot the autocorrelation of the number of 
### holiday trips per quarter in Melbourne

# plot it first 
d %>%
  filter(Region == "Melbourne",
         Purpose == "Holiday") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point() 

# calculate stuff
library(fpp2)
d %>%
  filter(Region == "Melbourne",
         Purpose == "Holiday") %>%
  ACF(Trips) %>%
  autoplot()

```


```{r}
## f.
### plot the autocorrelation of the number of "Visiting" trips in Melbourne 
### between 2000 and 2005
d %>%
  mutate(year = year(Quarter)) %>%
  filter(Region == "Melbourne",
         Purpose == "Visiting",
         between(year, 2000, 2005)) %>%
  ACF(Trips) %>%
  autoplot()

```


```{r}
## g.
### Use the Ljung-Box test to test for autocorrelation in the number of
### 1) holiday trips per quarter in Melbourne
### 2) Number of visiting trips to Melbourne between 2000 and 2005
### What are appropriate values for lag (h) and fitdf (k)?
d2 <- d %>% mutate(year = year(Quarter))

# not white noise. 
d2 %>%
  filter(Region == "Melbourne") %>%
  features(Trips, ljung_box, lag = 8)

# degrees of freedom. 
d2 %>% 
  filter(between(year, 2000, 2005),
         Region == "Melbourne",
         Purpose == "Visiting") %>%
  features(Trips, ljung_box, lag = 8)
  
# just a little plot
d2 %>%
  filter(Region == "Melbourne",
         Purpose == "Visiting") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() 

```

```{r}
## h.
### Do the results from the test align with your intuition?

# nej tak. 
```


```{r}
#### 2 #####

## a. plot the usgdp data
library(expsmooth) # more datasets (in ts format)
data(usgdp) 

tsGDP <- usgdp %>% as_tsibble()

```

```{r}
## b, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation for the usgdp data and plot it

# find lambda 
lambda <- tsGDP %>% 
  features(value, features = guerrero) %>%
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

# linear in n-space.  
tsGDP %>% 
  autoplot(box_cox(value, lambda)) +
  labs(title = "good test")

```

```{r}
## c.
### Would a Box-Cox transformation be helpful for the cangas data? Why/why not?

c <- cangas %>% as_tsibble() 

# perhaps 
p1 <- autoplot(c)

# do it. 
lambda <- c %>% 
  features(value, features = guerrero) %>%
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

# new plot.. 
p2 <- c %>% 
  autoplot(box_cox(value, lambda)) +
  labs(title = "good test")

# plot the stuff. 
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2)

```

```{r}
## c. 
### 1) Fit a number of appropriate baseline models to the entropy of the Danish 
###    speeches you calculated last time.
### 2) Check the residuals. Are they uncorrelated and normally distributed; 
###    is there something you didn't model?
### 3) Divide the speeches into a train set including all speeches from the 
###    beginning until the end of Lars LÃ¸kke's term. Use Mette Frederiksen's
###    speeches as the test set. How well are you able to predict the
###    entropy of her speeches?
```
