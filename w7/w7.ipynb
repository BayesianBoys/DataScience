    "This class is going to be an introduction to using R for time series analysis and forecasting. We will spend some time getting used to working with some of the packages in the  _tidyverts_.\n",

    "## Using R with Jupyter on UCloud\n",
    "I have made a virtual R environment which includes the packages you _should_ need for the time series part of the course under common/renvs. To use it, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the common folder when you start the Jupyter app\n",
    "2. Open a terminal and navigate to the renvs folder (cd common/renvs)\n",
    "3. Run the activate_renv.sh script (bash activate_renv.sh)\n",
    "4. Once it has run, refresh the page (press f5 or reload the page)\n",
    "5. If you open the launcher you should now see the r_ts_kernel. If you open a Jupyter notebook (for instance this one) you should be able to choose *r_ts_kernel* as the R kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at some point you want to create your own R environment for UCloud, just modify the create_renv.sh script (ask me if you need help). \n",

    "## Data Science Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend following the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/) project structure. It's super simple to use: follow the commands on the Github page, and it will automatically create a project folder with many premade folders for you to use (and customize to your need). Read more on suggested use cases etc. on their [website](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#analysis-is-a-dag).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also check out Danielle Navarros [slides](https://slides.djnavarro.net/project-structure/#1) on project structure, and the corresponding [template](https://github.com/djnavarro/newproject/) for a slightly simpler setup."

    "3. Familiarize yourself with the folder structure and check the [accompanying website](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#analysis-is-a-dag) for recommendations on how to use the project. Remember, this is just a guide. Not everything will be applicable to your project, so make sure to remove/add/modify the structure as it suits your preferences and project."

    "tsibbles work much like the tibbles you know from the Tidyverse, but require an _index_ (and optionally _keys_) and are specialized for time series. The _index_ is the timeseries index (e.g. the date, month etc), and _keys_ are group variables. In most ways, it is highly similar to tibbles, and supports the tidyverse _verbs_ such as mutate, summarize, filter, select etc. \n",
